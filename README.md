## I'm a Full Stack Developer

I don't like to call myself a senior developer because it makes me feel old, but I've been in web development for quite a while. It started with my first web development job about twenty years ago, and it's been a crazy ride since then. Before that, I was obsessed with Borland C++ Builder, and I was pretty good at that, but I digress.

My strong suit is ASPNET, and recently, I started the migration to .NET 8, feeling like Christmas already. I also work with different flavors of NodeJS, and I've been publishing my apps in AWS Amplify, using all sorts of gizmos.

My favorite framework so far for the front end is VUE. I know, I know, but I like it.

For mobile development, my go-to is Flutter because it's fun and easy to use. You can build something useful in a couple of weeks, and it is well-maintained.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my invoice cloud system, and recently, I decided I would add an online school, where I'm going to teach first how to use my software, but later, I'll sell courses to more advanced topics. So, there's a lot of work to be done.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning to build custom firmware for the ESP platform using C and the ESP-IDF framework. I'm enjoying that a lot because working in something so constrained is challenging.

âš¡ Fun fact: I love the Monk TV Series and have watched all the seasons 5 to 6 times. I'm not calling myself a "Monk-like developer," but that's not a bad idea. It is indeed an excellent plot for a TV series.

ðŸ“« You can reach me here; I'm sure you can leave a message somewhere around a button.
